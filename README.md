# Projects
A repository of my projects in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python

Coffee and Cakes is a simply website, no CSS applied. It has three pages, working links and working contact button.

Let's Travel. In this website mock-up the travel pictures are the main focus. Individual pictures to each blog entry and a larger carousel at the top of the page keep the end user engaged.

Exotic Car is a one page mock-up with a heavy amount of CSS code. It's all about style and the color scheme gives it a modern and slick look. Pointer change, header and footer transitions, and custom buttons for the social links.

Gotham is a blog sitewith custom fonts, an aside bar with a custom calendar,custom search bar, and custom social link buttons. This website relies heavly on flexbox.
